# Stylus-Controlled-Synthesizer
This project builds a stylus-controlled analog synthesizer on a breadboard without a microcontroller. Using potentiometers and a stylus to select signals, it drives a 555 timer-based oscillator to generate tones, demonstrating analog electronics, modulation, and sound synthesis concepts.
## Project Abstract
This project highlights the creation of a stylus-controlled analog synthesizer constructed completely on a breadboard without the use of any microcontroller. 
Employing potentiometers as voltage dividers and a stylus for direct signal selection, it drives a 555 timer-based oscillator to produce variable tones. 
Emulating a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the circuit illustrates major concepts of analog electronics and frequency modulation. 
Though with fewer components, the system clearly demonstrates analog signal modulation, selection, and sound synthesis and hence serves as a mini and tutorial device for studying analog communication principles.
